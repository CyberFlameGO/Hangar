Stuff that needs to be done before I consider this a successful POC

- [x] initial setup (pages, layout, autoimport, basically the vitesse stuff)
- [x] windi/tailwind
- [x] store (with ssr)
- [x] async data replacement
- [ ] i18n
- [x] api calls
- [x] seo
- [ ] route perms
- [ ] error pages
- [ ] snackbar
- [ ] some basic pages
- [ ] maybe deployment alongside the existing frontend?
